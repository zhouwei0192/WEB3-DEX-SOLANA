# SOLANA SOR SmartContract

## Overview

The SOLANA SOR (Smart Order Router) SmartContract repository implements a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Solana blockchain. This project leverages the Solana Program Library (SPL) and Anchor framework to provide robust and efficient token swap functionality.

## Repository Structure

- `programs/`: Contains the Solana smart contracts (on-chain programs) for the DEX.
  - `src/`:
    - **adapters/**: Provides abstraction layers for integrating various external protocols and utilities into the DEX, ensuring a modular and extensible architecture.
    - **instructions/**: Contains the core program logic, handling essential DEX functionalities such as token swaps, liquidity management, and fee calculations.
    - **utils/**: Includes utility functions and helper methods used across the program.
- `Anchor.toml`: Configuration file for Anchor projects.
- `Cargo.toml`: Rust project configuration file.
- `package.json`: Contains dependencies and scripts for JavaScript-based tests or utilities.

## Key Features

- **Split Trading**: The DexRouter allows for split trading, enabling users to execute trades across multiple liquidity sources.
- **Security**: The contracts has been audited by okx innter audit team.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily integrates with other Solana-based programs and tokens.
- **Anchor Framework**: Utilizes Anchor for seamless program development and deployment.
- **High Performance**: Built on Solana, ensuring high throughput and low latency.


## Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install Rust from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
- **Solana CLI**: Install the Solana command-line tools from [Solana CLI Documentation](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools) (Recommended version: **1.18.26** for compatibility).
- **Anchor Framework**: Install Anchor by running:

  ```bash
  cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force
  ```

  Alternatively, follow the installation guide from the [Solana Documentation](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation) to ensure compatibility and proper setup.(Recommended version: **0.30.0** and **0.30.1** for compatibility)
- **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) for JavaScript utilities.
